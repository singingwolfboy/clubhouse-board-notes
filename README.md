# Notes for Clubhouse

This project is a [Chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions)
that allows you to embed notes on [Clubhouse.io](https://clubhouse.io/),
tracked and maintained using [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

## Why?

An important part of [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
is the retrospective meeting. In this meeting, the team typically comes up
with specific actions they can take to improve their work in the next sprint.

[Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/) is a nifty project management tool,
but it doesn't have any way to keep track of retrospective actions.
By embedding these retrospective actions on a Clubhouse board, teams can
keep these retrospective actions in mind every day, and make sure to follow
up on those actions.

## Google Integration

This project stores data using [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/),
for ease of use and collaboration. When you first set up this extension,
you'll be asked to select the Google Sheet you want to use to hold and manage
this data.
